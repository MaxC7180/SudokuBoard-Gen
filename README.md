# SudokuBoard-Gen
This creates a valid sudoku board as well as a possible but not unique answer key. This generator also gives you three choices of difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard to choose from in which the harder you choose the less numbers you are given. The main code is in "Sudoku_Game_2.m" and the rest can be viewed as helper functions.
